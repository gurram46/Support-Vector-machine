# Support Vector Machine with Mushroom Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the Mushroom Dataset. The goal is to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on various features.

## Dataset Selection
For this assignment, we utilize the widely recognized Mushroom Dataset.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load the Mushroom dataset and perform fundamental data exploration.
- Utilize histograms, box plots, or density plots to understand feature distributions.
- Investigate feature correlations to discern relationships within the data.

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing
- Encode categorical variables if necessary.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- Employ scatter plots, pair plots, or relevant visualizations to comprehend feature distributions and relationships.
- Visualize class distributions to gauge dataset balance or imbalance.

### Task 4: SVM Implementation
- Implement a basic SVM classifier using Python libraries like scikit-learn.
- Train the SVM model on the training data.
- Evaluate model performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### Task 5: Visualization of SVM Results
- Visualize classification results on the testing data.

### Task 6: Parameter Tuning and Optimization
- Experiment with different SVM hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, regularization parameter) to optimize performance.

### Task 7: Comparison and Analysis
- Compare SVM performance with various kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function).
- Analyze SVM strengths and weaknesses for the Mushroom dataset based on EDA and visualization results.
- Discuss practical implications of SVM in real-world classification tasks.
